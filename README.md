# Turing_Instability

Solving Reaction diffusion in a Square environment with von-Neumann boundary condition (setting the derivative w.r.t place to Zero on the boundary) with an implicit method.

Laplace matrix was approximated using a 5-point method, and sparse matrix in Matlab was used.

This is a sample result from Truing Pattern simulation:
